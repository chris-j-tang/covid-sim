## The geography

`CovidSim` simulates disease spread in a geographical region, which in principle can be at any scale, but in practice is a region or country.

In consequence, the model must be told the geography of a region, such as its population density, plus other specific information. This information is specified as a mixture of parameters and input population density files.

## Main command-line arguments

A typical run specifies (i) files that contain simulation parameters (the `/A`, `/P` and `/PP` option) , (ii) a population density file for the country we're simulating (the `/D` option) and (iii) the name of output files that summarise the results of the simulation (the `/O` option).
```
CovidSim
    /c:NumThreads
    /A:AdminParamFile
    /PP:PreParameterFile
    /P:ParameterFile
    /O:OutputFilesPrefix
    [/D:PopulationDensityFile]
    [/L:NetworkFileToLoad | /S:NetworkFileToSave]
    SetupSeed1 SetupSeed2 RunSeed1 RunSeed2
```

Explanation of the arguments with examples:
- `/c:32` the number of parallel threads to use
- `/A:sample_admin.txt` a file specifying parameters determining the geography to be modelled
- `/PP:preUS_R0=2.0_BM.txt` a file that defines transmission and calibration parameters for a specific run
- `/P:p_NoInt.txt` a file that defines intervention parameters for a specific run
- `/O:./output/NoInt_R0=1` specifies the prefix pathname for a collection of output files that contain simulation data. The output files are tabular `tsv` data (but with the extension `.xls`)
- `[/D:pop_usa_adm2.txt]` a population density file for a specific geography (e.g. a country)
- `[/L:NetworkFileToLoad | /S:NetworkFileToSave]`. For efficiency, we can run and, as a side-effect, generate a [network file](./model-glossary.md#Network\ file) that assigns [people](./model-glossary.md#People) to [places](./model-glossary.md#Places). The [network file](./model-glossary.md#Network\ file) may then be re-used for subsequent runs (with different input parameters for the same geography). The network file is a non-portable `.bin`. Generate this file with the `/S` option and re-use it (in a subsequent run) with the `/L` option.
- `SetupSeed1 SetupSeed2` Random number generator seeds used when initialising the model, including creating the networkfile (large positive integers).
- `RunSeed1 RunSeed2` Random number generator seeds used when running the model. These can be varied to do multiple runs with the same network file (large positive integers).

## Additional command-line arguments

    [/AP:AirTravelFile]
    [/s:SchoolFile]
    [/R:R0scaling]
    SetupSeed1 SetupSeed2 RunSeed1 RunSeed2
```
Explanation of additional arguments:
- `[/AP:AirTravelFile]` Air travel data for a specific geography (unused currently)
- `[/s:USschools.txt]` School information for a specific geography (currently only used for US).
- `[/R:1.1]`. Spcifies the reproduction number (`R0`), as a multiplier of 2. `R0`, for a disease is the number of secondary cases in susceptibles per infected case. These commandline parameter is read into `P.R0scaling` which scales the `R0` parameter (specified in the parameter file), which is useful when we want repeated that *only* vary `R0`). For COVID-19, `/R:1.4` to `/R:1.6` is suitable.
- `/CLP1:100000`, `/CLP2:0` etc. are special parameters that interact with wildcards `#1`, `#2` etc. in the intervention parameter file (and less often the pre-parameter file). Wildcard `#n` is replaced by the value of `CLPn`. This is useful to vary parts of parameter files at run-time (e.g. to undertake sensitivity analysis) without needing to generate entirely new parameter files.

## Input files

The main inputs files are parameter files and population density files (for specific geographies).

### Parameters

There are a very large number of parameters to `CovidSim`. This repo is undergoing active development and rationalisation. The parameters are currently not self-documenting.

Parameter values are read in from parameter files by function `ReadParams`, which matches up a parameter description string to the according variable in the source code. The only method to determine the precise meaning of a specific parameter is to read the code.

### Parameter files

The parameters are specified in admin, pre-parameter and intervention parameter files. Both files have the same format.

Admin and pre-parameter files contain parameters whose values are *common* to a series of runs (i.e. defining geographies and transmission parameters). Intervention parameter files contain parameters whose values are more likely to *differ* between a series of runs. 

The format is a sequence of:
```
[Description of Parameter]
value
``` 
If you see multiple numbers below the parameter description, then disregard them. The simulation uses only the numbers immediately below the parameter description. 

An example parameter file is `./data/param_files/p_NoInt.txt`.

### Population density file

A binary geography-specific file used to assign people to cells. Currently these files are generated and provided by Imperial College.

An example population density file is `./data/populations/wpop_eur.txt`.

The information contained in this file includes:

| longitude | latitude | number of people | country code | admin unit code | 
|--|-:|-:|-:|-:|
| -156.68333 | 71.325| 30| 46 | 4602017|
|-156.76666	| 71.3 | 1 |46 | 4602017|
| ... | ... | ... | ...| ... |

#### How are population density files produced?

Physical geography data: each geography has a shape file (`.shp`) of polygons and meta-data (`.dbf`) with GPS coordinates. Admin units are a set of polygons.

Human geography data specifies where people live on the same scale as a `CovidSim`'s microcell (1/120th of a degree).

Imperial College combines the physical and human data to calculate population densities per polygon. This process produces the population density file.

A companion to the population density file is a metafile that maps admin unit codes to string descriptions (e.g., codes to US state names).

### School files

The first line of a school file has (1 + 2`n`) integer values, where `n` is the number of school types. The values are: 
  - Index `0`: The number of types of schools. E.g. a geography might two school place types (primary and secondary).
  - Index 1 + 2`i`: The total number of schools of type `i`
  - Index 2 + 2`i`: The number of age bands in schools of type `i`

E.g., if a geography has 2 school types then the first line of the school file might be:
```
2 100 3 50 4
```
representing 2 school types, with 100 of type 0 (which as 3 age classes) and 50 of type 1 (which has 4 age classes).

The remainder of the file has a row per school. E.g.:

| longitude | latitude | place type index | #people in the school | #people in age band 1| # people in age band 2 | ... | # people in age band n | 
|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|
| -156.68333 | 71.325| 0 | 80 | 30 | 46 | ... | 4 |
| -123.32 | 70.35 | 0 | 32 | 23 | 3 | ... | 6 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

The place type index for schools is `0`. 

## Output files

Simulation output files are produced by each run.
Switches in parameter files can control the precise nature of the outputs (e.g., at country level, or at admin unit level, or both etc.). E.g.
```
[Do Severity Analysis]
1 
```
then `severity.xls` is generated. 

A run is extinct if the disease dies out, otherwise a run is non extinct.

Outputs can be averaged over all extinct (`avE` suffix) and non-extinct (`avNE` suffix) runs. Currently, we are simulating large epidemics that essentially become deterministic and therefore we focus on `avNE` files.

We pay most attention to `avNE` (average of non-extinct realisations) files. 

Below is an incomplete specification of the output file formats.

## R summary visualisations

Some [R scripts](../Rscripts) provide basic visualisations of model runs. 

If the R software is installed and output files of model runs have been created in folder `folder`, they can be visualised using the commands

```
Rscript Rscripts/PlotsSpatial.R [folder-where-the-data-is]
Rscript Rscripts/CompareScenarios.R [folder-where-the-data-is]
```

This will create `.png`s visualising the data in a new subfolder called `Plots`.
